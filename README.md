# Final Project - Skripsi

Hi, There!

Here is my project for thesis in Brawijaya University majoring Information Systems. In this project, I clustered Twitter user opinions about MSIB (Magang and Studi Independen Bersertifikat) using DBSCAN algorithms. From this clustering, resulted nine big topics, such as the benefits of the MSIB program, which provide students with opportunities to learn outside their study program, invitations to participate in the program, support for the program, program requirements, campus contributions, program registration process, selection process, assignments given during program implementation, and disbursement of financial assistance.
